# Guess the number game
Simple game in which the user has to guess a number between 0 and 30. 
At launch the game stores in its memory a random number which then the user has to guess by submitting their guess in the input field and clicking on the "submit" button. 
Every time button is clicked, the game shows the number of attempts.
Once the guess equals the random number, the game shows that the user has won in a specific number of attempts and asks if the user wants to play again.
